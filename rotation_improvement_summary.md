# Rotation Strategy Improvement Summary

## Overview
The improved rotation strategy was developed to address the low win rate (42.8%) of the original rotation strategy by implementing key enhancements while keeping the code simple and efficient.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing**
- Base position: 10% (vs fixed in original)
- Range: 5-15% based on stock volatility
- Lower volatility stocks get larger positions
- Higher volatility stocks get smaller positions

### 2. **Trailing Stop Implementation**
- Activates at 10% profit
- Trails by 5% to lock in gains
- Protects profits while allowing upside

### 3. **ATR-Based Dynamic Stop Losses**
- Uses 2x ATR multiplier
- Adapts to each stock's volatility
- More room for volatile stocks

### 4. **Time-Based Exit Strategy**
- Exits positions after 30 days if return < 5%
- Frees up capital for better opportunities
- Prevents holding underperformers

### 5. **Market Breadth Checking**
- Requires 40% of stocks to have positive momentum
- Reduces positions in weak markets
- Only keeps top 5 stocks in poor conditions

### 6. **Relative Strength Scoring**
- Compares performance vs market average
- Prioritizes outperformers
- Better stock selection

## Expected Results

Based on the improvements:

1. **Better Risk Management**
   - Lower maximum drawdowns
   - More consistent returns
   - Protected profits

2. **Improved Win Rate**
   - Exit underperformers early
   - Lock in profits with trailing stops
   - Better entry timing

3. **Higher Sharpe Ratio**
   - Better risk-adjusted returns
   - Reduced volatility
   - More efficient capital use

## Code Structure

The improved strategy maintains simplicity:
- Single file implementation
- Clear scoring system
- Efficient backtesting
- No complex dependencies (removed TA-Lib)

## Testing

To run comparison:
```bash
python quick_rotation_comparison.py  # 30-day quick test
python detailed_rotation_test.py     # 60-day detailed test
```

## Next Steps

1. Integration with portfolio paper trading
2. Real-time monitoring of exit reasons
3. Parameter optimization based on market conditions
